I am a detail-oriented computer vision engineer who loves to work with new technologies in order to solve today's challenges.
As a highly experienced programmer, I strive to build robust applications and pipelines in many different programming languages such as Python, C/C++ & JavaScript.
I possess an unwavering passion for everything related to AI and love to tinker around on various linux systems.

From 2017 to 2023, I worked as a PhD researcher at the [EAVISE](https://eavise.be) research group of the KU Leuven.
I worked on a variety of different projects for industrial partners, researching how to best optimize object detection from aerial viewpoints.
In that time, I designed pipelines to run neural networks on huge satellite orthomosaic images, I improved object detection models by fusing different modalities such as RGB and depth images and I explored different methodologies to improve the latency of convolutional neural networks with the goal of deploying them on embedded GPUs.

As a post-doctoral researcher, I currently investigate multi-object detection & tracking in a project about [24/7 dog monitoring]({% link _projects/phd-04-jnj.md %}).
